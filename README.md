Visualization of simple python network-based signature intrusion detection system

## Warning
I'm taking the code concept below and visualizing it.
I just changed some structures in the original code to make it compatible with PyQt5.

You have to take a look to the original code. Because the general concept and some parts of the code is taken from there.
